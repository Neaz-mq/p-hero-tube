            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold ml-10">1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h2> <br>
            <p class="text-xl font-normal ml-10 text-start"> - In JavaScript, 'var', 'let', and 'const' are used to
                declare variables, but they have different scopes
                and behaviors:
                <br> <br>
                'var': Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped. This means they are visible throughout the
                entire function in which they are declared, even if declared within loops or conditional statements.
                `var` declarations are also subject to hoisting, meaning they are moved to the top of their function
                scope during compilation.
                <br><br>
                'let': Variables declared with `let` are block-scoped. They are limited in visibility to the block
                (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are defined. This makes `let` more predictable and safer than
                `var` for avoiding unintended variable leaks or scope issues. `let` is not hoisted, so it's only
                accessible after its declaration.
                <br> <br>
                'const': Variables declared with `const` are also block-scoped like `let`, but they cannot be reassigned
                after their initial value is assigned. However, it's important to note that the "constant" here only
                applies to the binding between the variable name and its value. If the value is an object or an array,
                you can still modify the properties or elements of the object or array.
                <br> <br>
                Using `let` and `const` is generally recommended over `var` as they provide better control over variable
                scope and can help prevent unintentional bugs in your code. It's a good practice to use `const` for
                values that should not change and `let` for values that might need to change. <br> <br>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold ml-10">2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2> <br>
            <p class="text-xl font-normal ml-10 text-start">In JavaScript, both 'null' and 'undefined'='' represent the
                absence of a value, but they are used in
                slightly different contexts:
                <br> <br>
                'null': It is a deliberate value that represents the absence of any object value. It's often used to
                indicate the intentional absence of a value or when you want to reset a variable to indicate that it has
                no valid object value.
                <br><br>
                'undefined': A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value is automatically
                initialized with `undefined`. It can also be explicitly assigned to a variable. `undefined` is typically
                used to indicate the absence of a value or when a value is missing.

                <br><br>

                Use cases for 'null':
                - Explicitly indicating the absence of a value.
                - Resetting a variable that held an object.
                - Checking for the presence or absence of a value in custom logic.
                <br><br>
                Use cases for 'undefined':
                - Default function parameters that are not provided.
                - Variables that haven't been initialized.
                - Properties or variables that don't exist in an object or scope.

                <br><br>

                It's important to handle both `null` and `undefined` properly in your code to avoid unexpected behavior
                or errors. You can use checks like `if (variable === null)` or `if (typeof variable === 'undefined')` to
                differentiate between the two.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold ml-10">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h2> <br>
            <p class="text-xl font-normal ml-10 text-start">- REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it's
                an architectural style for designing networked
                applications, particularly web services. A RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of
                rules and conventions that allow different software applications to communicate with each other over the
                internet using HTTP methods.
                <br> <br>
                In a RESTful API:
                - Resources (such as data or objects) are identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).
                - HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are used to perform operations on these resources.
                - Responses are typically returned in a structured format, often in JSON or XML.
                <br> <br>
                Key characteristics of a RESTful API include: 
                <br><br>
                i. **Statelessness:** Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed
                to understand and process the request. The server doesn't store client state between requests.
                <br> <br>
                ii. **Client-Server Architecture:** The client and server are separate entities. The client is
                responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server handles data storage,
                processing, and security.
                <br> <br>
                iii. **Cacheability:** Responses from the server can be cached to improve performance. Clients can use
                caching to avoid unnecessary requests to the server.
                <br> <br>
                iv. **Uniform Interface:** A consistent and standardized way to interact with resources is provided.
                This includes using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and following a resource's URL
                structure.
                <br> <br>
                v. **Layered System:** Intermediary servers (proxies, gateways, etc.) can be used between clients and
                the main server, allowing for additional functionalities without affecting the client.
                <br> <br>
                vi. **Code on Demand (optional):** Servers can extend the functionality of clients by sending executable
                code. This aspect is optional in a RESTful architecture.
                <br> <br>
                RESTful APIs are widely used for building web applications, mobile apps, and services that need to
                interact with each other over the internet. They provide a flexible and scalable way to expose and
                consume data and functionalities between different software systems.
